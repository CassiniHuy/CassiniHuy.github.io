Hi, I'm Cheng'an Wei, now a PhD student at Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Professor Kai Chen](http://kaichen.org/). I completed my undergraduate studies at Sichuan University, where I was part of the School of Cyber Science and Engineering and the Wuyuzhang Honors College.

My research interests lie in the fields of security, interpretability, and privacy-preserving methods for AI. 

You can find more about my work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uOsZX7EAAAAJ) and [GitHub](https://github.com/CassiniHuy).
